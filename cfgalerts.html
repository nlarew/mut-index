Introduction
Configure an Alert
Delete or Disable an Alert



Introduction¶
You can select which conditions trigger alerts and how users are notified.

Default Alert Settings¶
Atlas provides the following default alerts for a new group:

Replica set has no primary
Cluster is missing an active mongos
Disk space % used on Data Partition is
Disk I/O % utilization on Data Partition is
User joined the group
Users awaiting approval to join group
Credit card is about to expire



Notification Options¶
When you configure an alert, you select how notifications are sent. You can
select multiple notification methods, such as email, text message, or team
collaboration tools.
To use certain notification methods, you must first enter default values in
Group Settings, accessed through the Settings tab.
Atlas fills in the default values automatically when you select that
notification method. If a default value becomes invalid, Atlas sends
an email to the group owner. The following notification methods require
default values in Group Settings:

PagerDuty
Flowdock
HipChat
Slack
Webhook




Configure an Alert¶
When you create a new alert you have the option of using an existing alert
setting as a template.
1
Click Alerts.¶

2
Choose whether to clone an existing alert setting as a template.¶
To create a new alert without cloning an existing setting, click the
Add button and select New Alert.
To clone an existing setting, click the Alert Settings tab;
Locate the alert setting; Click the ellipsis icon and select
Clone.

3
Select the condition that triggers the alert.¶
In the Alert if section, select the target component and the
condition. For explanations of alert conditions, see
Alert Conditions.

4
Apply the alert only to specific targets. (Optional)¶
If the options in the For section are available, you can
optionally filter the alert to apply only to a subset of the targets.
The matches field can use regular expressions.

5
Select the alert recipients and delivery methods.¶
In the Send to section, click Add and select from
the options described below. To help eliminate false positives, set the time
to elapse before the condition triggers the alert.






Notification Option
Description



Group
Sends the alert to a group, either by email or SMS. SMS
uses the number configured for each user’s account. To send to specific
roles, deselect All Roles and select the roles.

Atlas User
Sends the alert to a user, either by email or SMS. SMS uses
the number configured for the user’s account.

Email
Sends the alert to an email address.

SMS
Sends the alert to a mobile number. Atlas removes all punctuation
and letters and uses only the digits. If you are outside of the United
States or Canada, include ‘011’ and the country code. For example, for
New Zealand enter ‘01164’ before the phone number. As an alternative,
use a Google Voice number. Atlas uses the U.S.-based Twilio to send SMS messages.

HipChat
Sends the alert to a HipChat room message stream. Enter the HipChat
room name and API token.

Slack
Sends the alert to a Slack channel. Enter the channel name and either
an API token or a Bot token. To create an API token, see the
https://api.slack.com/web page in your Slack account. For
information on Bot users in Slack, see
https://api.slack.com/bot-users.

Flowdock
Sends the alert to a Flowdock account. Enter the following:
Org Name: The Flowdock organization name in lower-case
letters. This is the name that appears after www.flowdock.com/app/
in the URL string.
Flow Name: The flow name in lower-case letters. The flow
name appears after the organization name in the URL string:
www.flowdock.com/app/<organization-name>/<flow-name>
User API Token: Your Flowdock “personal API token” found on
the https://www.flowdock.com/account/tokens page of your Flowdock
account.


PagerDuty
Sends the alert to a PagerDuty
account. Enter only the PagerDuty service key. Define escalation rules
and alert assignments directly in PagerDuty.
This option is available only for alerts that require acknowledgement.
Informational alerts, such as the alert that a user has joined a group,
cannot use this notification method.
Users can acknowledge PagerDuty alerts only from the PagerDuty
dashboard.


Webhook
Sends an HTTP POST request to an endpoint for programmatic processing.
The request body contains a JSON document that uses the same format as
the Atlas API’s Alerts resource. This option is available only
if you have configured Webhook settings on the Group Settings page.
Grant the following CIDR ranges access to the endpoint resource:

4.71.186.128/25
4.35.16.128/25

Click Save.¶



Delete or Disable an Alert¶
If you delete or disable an alert setting, Atlas cancels active alerts
related to the setting. A disabled alert setting remains visible but
grayed-out and can be later re-enabled. A deleted alert setting does not
remain visible.
